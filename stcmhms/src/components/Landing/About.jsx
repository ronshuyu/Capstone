        <h3>About our System</h3>
        <h2>AI-Driven Mental Health Monitoring System</h2>
        <p>
            Our mental health monitoring system is a proactive, secure, and insightful platform designed to support students' emotional well-being through early detection and guided intervention. It combines self-reported data, behavioral patterns, and emotional tone analysis to assess a user's mental state and provide personalized feedback. The system continuously monitors changes in engagement, such as how often a user logs in, fil ls out mood check-ins, or abruptly exits without inputâ€”signals that may reflect fear, denial, or emotional distress. 
        </p>
        <p>
           While it cannot fully support users who refuse to engage at all, it can identify these patterns and refer concerning cases to human counselors for careful follow-up. By blending AI and compassionate oversight, the system aims to create a safe space where students can open up at their own pace without fear of judgment.
